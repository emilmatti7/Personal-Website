                <h3>About</h3>
                <p>Thanks to the Moneyball era of the Oakland Athletics in 2002-2003, decision making in modern day baseball has become
                extremely data-driven. Nearly every single statistic is now recorded ranging from pitch velocity to bat speed to even
                the time it takes for a team to warm up in between innings. As a college baseball player who was constantly thrown
                statistics every time I reunited with the team for practices and games, I was captivated by the intricate measures and
                insights you can pull from the game of baseball.</p>
                <p>Contrast to professional baseball teams, college baseball programs don’t have access to data teams to allow coaches and
                players to make data-driven decisions. College baseball teams also don’t have as much recorded data as the MLB such as
                pitch and swing metrics. Therefore, I had a value to add to the offense of my baseball team and give them insight to
                pitches they may encounter when at-bat. Since there wasn’t data on pitches across college baseball, I used data from
                Major League Baseball because the game is very similar from college to professional. With this data, I performed an
                exploratory data analysis to give more insight to pitches for the offense on my team to have a better sense of what’s
                coming at them.</p>
