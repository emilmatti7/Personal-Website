							<!-- <p>I was born and raised in a tight knit community in Parsippany, New Jersey located 40 minutes outside of New York
								City.
								I’m proud to say that I am a Filipino-American and raised by two immigrant parents. Growing up with an older
								brother who
								is 7 years older brought the competitive nature out of me. Countless losses to my brother in wiffle ball,
								monopoly and
								video games has only shaped me into someone who isn’t afraid to fail and chase what I want. My big brother set
								the bar
								high for me growing up and I’m forever grateful for that.</p>
							<p>Sports have been a huge part of my life, however, baseball was something that I had a passion for and dedicated
								my life
								to. Waking up at 6 am for workouts before school and spending my summers playing 60 games in 90 degree weather
								has
								brought me many lessons beyond the game itself. My love for the game allowed me to meet so many people, see many
								different places and earn a scholarship to play at a Division 1 school. The path to playing in college was no
								easy feat
								but with enough love in what you do and the right people around you makes everything worthwhile.</p>
							<P>College opened my eyes to so many different things. I attended Wagner College in New York City where I studied
								Economics
								while juggling a full baseball schedule including team weight lifts, practices and games. There were a few
								takeaways I
								got from my experience at college. The first being that personal connection creates a better atmosphere and
								conveys
								value and appreciation in a team setting. I made it my mission to meet as many people as I can since personal
								relationships are something I value the most. Secondly, in college you will be put into a bunch of different
								groups and
								it is a great time to practice your leadership skills. It is important to get out of your comfort zone and put
								yourself
								in groups/situations you wouldn’t normally be in as I believe it is the only way to grow. The last and biggest
								takeaway
								I received from college is patience. You meet so many people with different values and upbringings and learning
								to be
								patient when working with others is a skill I always strive to progress in. College helped me grasp this concept
								as it
								is a skill that is so important in life since, whether you like it or not, you will constantly be surrounded
								with all
								different types of people.</P>
							<P>What I’ve learned through my childhood, baseball and college is valuable and applicable to my life in every
								aspect. We
								all have a choice to either sleepwalk through life or make the most of every moment. What will you choose?</P>
