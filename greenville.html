                        What The World Has To Offer…</h1>
                    <p>Inspired by Max Hawkings Ted Talk, this is my solution to break a never ending cycle of comfort. <br />
                        Here is the <a href="https://github.com/emilmatti7/greenville_yelp/blob/main/greenville_generator.ipynb" target="_blank">notebook</a> as you can run the code with Binder.<br />

               <h3>My Story</h3>
                <p>I found myself in a constant loop. Waking up at the same exact time, working out at the same exact time, opening up my laptop at the same exact time, going to sleep at the same exact time, then repeating it all next day. After listening to Max Hawkins Ted Talk, it was a wake up call that I was living my life like an algorithm. I was so comfortable in my routine, the people around me and the hobbies I took up that it wasn’t allowing me to expand my horizon and grow as a person.</p>
                <p>I thought about this a lot recently. It particularly brought me back to the days my best friends Ryan, Bener and I turned 17 and was finally able to drive. Something we loved and still love to do as friends, is go out to eat. Sharing meals with others, especially your best friends, brings you closer together than you were before. However, when deciding where to eat it would end in constant hesitation and another burger at Fuddruckers.</p>
                <p>Fast forward to 22 years old and a month away from moving in with my best friend Ryan in Greenville, South Carolina, I do not want to make the same mistake as I did in my naive teen years. To avoid allowing our interests and what we already know decide an already predictable restaurant choice or night out at a familiar bar, I created a random generator. To do this, I grabbed data from Yelp’s API of “Things to do” in a 25 mile radius of our apartment in Greenville, SC. This gave me over 600 different things to do ranging from hike trails to jazz bars to minor league baseball games. With the click of a button, it will generate a random row and give us the name of the place, address, phone number, rating and the amount of reviews written about it. Therefore, the next time we have to make a decision on how to spend our Saturday, hopefully this generator will bring us to a side of Greenville we’ve never seen before or meet people we’d never think we’d come across.</p>
                <p>With a brand new city at the palm of our hands, Ryan and I have realized that change and letting go is necessary for growth. And one of the best parts of our lives is that we never know what’s going to happen next. </p>
