                    <p>This is an end-to-end data science project<br />
                    to better understand the reasons behind a student's decision during the pandemic.<br />
                    Here is the statistical analysis done on <a href="https://github.com/emilmatti7/pandemic-prediction" target="_blank">Jupyter Notebook</a>.</p>

                <p>The data was collected through an online survey on google form and was sent to the student mailing list of Wagner
                College. After two weeks of mass emails to the university and personally reaching out to students to complete the
                survey, there were a total of 202 responses. The survey consisted of 13 questions with very simple and easy answers. The
                google form was linked to a google sheet as the sheet updated every time someone answered. It needed to be linked to a
                google sheet because it made the response into a structured dataset. This then made it easier to convert into a csv file
                and ready for data cleaning and data manipulation. </p>
                <p>An exploratory data analysis is performed on Python and is presented with visualizations and statistics. The survey asks students to verify the state that they reside in. This was a really important factor in determining
                their decision to make the trip and quarantine in New York before move-in day. Students from 27
                different states filled out the survey as a student at Wagner College. The majority of the students state that they
                reside in New York and New Jersey since Wagner is in New York City with New Jersey being a neighboring state. With
                Wagner being a very diverse university, students being out of state makes it difficult to come to New York with the
                travel restrictions it had placed as of August 2020. Figure 5 shows a crosstab of the amount of students who live in a
                restricted state in terms of New York’s state law, who don't live in a restricted state and both of their decisions. It
                shows a total of 42 students who live in a restricted state and a total of 160 students who do not live in a restricted
                state. However, there were 18 students that were added to the total of students who did not live in a restricted state
                because they resided outside the country. Out of the 42 students who live in a restricted state, 15 decided to not go
                through the quarantine process in New York while 27 students decided to come to New York and attended in person courses.
                Of the students who do not live in a restricted state, 110 students came back to campus while 50 decided to stay home.</p>
                <p>Professors also had the option to teach in person or construct their course(s) online through Zoom. This factored in a
                student’s decision to come back to campus or stay online based on what their schedule looked like. As seen in Figure 6,
                for the students who decided to come back to campus, there was an average of 2.3 classes that were made online by their
                professors. However, for the people who decided to stay home, there was an average of 3.7 online classes on their
                schedule. As expected, the more online classes a student had on their schedule gave them more of a reason to not pay for
                room and board. The more classes a student had in person, the more the student would want to take advantage of the
                resources available provided by the school.</p>
                <p>The student-athlete population at Wagner College makes up almost a quarter of the whole student body. According to the
                Equity in Athletics Disclosure Act (Fahey, 2020), there are a total of 562 participating student-athletes in 25
                different sports as of August 31, 2020. In this sample, Figure 7 highlights student-athletes in orange, non
                student-athletes in blue and their decision. The bar chart shows that 69 of the 87 student-athletes decided to come back
                to their respective teams on campus and participate in practice. In other words, 79.3% of student athletes decided to
                return to their sport. There are a total of 115 non student-athletes while only 59% of those students decided to come
                back. There are multiple reasons as to why a student-athlete wanted to come back to campus. One being that the athlete
                misses their sport since sports had been shut down 6 months prior to the fall semester. Another reason is that since the
                fall semester was an off season for all teams at Wagner, athletes felt the need to show up and earn a spot on the team
                or a spot as a starter. The data clearly shows that student-athletes wanted to get back to their sport and their fellow
                teammates.</p>
                <p>Data on the students’ major was also vital insight to their decision in the fall. Certain majors at Wagner were required
                to study on campus. The nursing and physician assistant programs are quite popular at Wagner College. The nursing
                students were required to be in person because of clinicals and simlab. Clinicals and simlabs that the program runs are
                a shadow of another nurse at a hospital and cannot be conducted online. In the physician assistant program, 4th and 5th
                year students within the program were required to show up to campus. To earn a certification, the physician assistant
                students were not allowed to do online clinicals in place of in person work. In order to graduate, the students needed
                to physically go to the hospitals in New York City. Out of the 202 students in the sample, 64 students were required to
                come back to campus for their field of study.</p>
                <p>The exploratory variables were narrowed down with personal experience and immense research. Although not every student’s
                situation in the 2020 Fall semester was the same, the variables were carefully considered and were decided based on
                strong impact. Issues throughout the experiment come from the data collection segment of the process. The data would be
                more accurate if there was a bigger sample size. The small sample size caused an unexpected sign within the estimated
                equation. Overall, in order to make this model statistically significant, a larger sample size must be obtained.
                The pandemic changed many lives in the past year, specifically universities across the country. This experiment’s aim
                was to add value to Wagner College with a model and analytical insight. In the future, I hope to expand research at
                Wagner and branch out to more universities in the United States. </p>
